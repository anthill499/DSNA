Recursion is where a function calls itself
The recursive case is when the function calls 
itself. 
The base case is when the function doesn’t call itself again … so it 
doesn’t go into an infinite loop

Call stack - uses a Stack data structure (FILO);
When you call a function
1) Whenever a function is called, your computer allocates memory for that function call
2) variables are set and the function is put on to the call stack
3) If that function calls other functions, those fns are pushed on top of the first function
in the call stack
4) Those last placed functions will be popped off/ returned first and handled first
5) When it comes time to return the first function, the whole thing is complete and popped
off the call stack

• The call stack can get very large, which takes up a lot of memory.
