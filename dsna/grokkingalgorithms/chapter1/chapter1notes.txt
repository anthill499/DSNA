An algorithm is a set of instructions for accomplishing a task

Time Complexity: Binary search halves input size at each step. O(log N) vs. simple search O(N)

1.1 Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you’re searching 
through it using binary search. What’s the maximum number of 
steps it would take?

ANS: 7 steps

1.2 Suppose you double the size of the list. What’s the maximum 
number of steps now

ANS: 8 steps
